Installation
------------

We recommend using the latest version of Python. The library supports Python
3.8 and newer (PyPy-3.9+ are supported too).

Muffin should be installed using pip: ::

    pip install muffin

The command will install minimal configuration.

To install Muffin with `gunicorn`, `uvicorn`, `uvloop`, `httptools` use the
command:

.. code-block:: console

  $ pip install muffin[standard]

Dependencies
````````````

These distributions will be installed automatically when installing **Muffin**.

* `ASGI-Tools`_ - ASGI_ Toolkit
* `Modconfig`_  - Simple hierarchic configuration manager

.. _ASGI-Tools: https://klen.github.io/asgi-tools/
.. _Modconfig: https://pypi.org/project/modconfig/

.. _quickstart:

Quickstart
----------

Example "Hello User" with the Muffin:

.. code-block:: python

    import muffin


    app = muffin.Application()


    @app.route('/', '/hello/{name}')
    async def hello(request):
        name = request.path_params.get('name', 'world')
        return f'Hello {name.title()}!'


What did that code do?

1. First we imported the ``muffin.Application`` class.  An instance of
   this class will be our application.
2. Next we create an instance of this class.
3. We then use the ``muffin.Application.route`` decorator to tell Muffin
   what URLs should trigger our handler function.
4. The function returns the message we want to display in the user's browser.


Save the script as `example.py` and run it using Uvicorn (or another ASGI_ server): ::

    $ uvicorn example:app

Open http://localhost:8000, http://localhost:8000/hello/username in your browser. Enjoy!
